            <p>Hello! I am Abigail Cinco, an aspiring web developer based in Toronto. 
                I have some experience in frontend and backend technologies to create responsive and professional-looking web applications. 
                Peruse my portfolio at your leisure.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey in web development began April of 2023.
                Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that
                have honed my skills in technologies such as 
                HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Handlebars, React, Node JS, Sequelize, MySQL, Express, and MongoDB.
            </p>
